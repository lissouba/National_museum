				<p>In the Northern Province of Gicumbi district, 80 kilometres northeast of Kigali at Mulindi w’Intwali lies the National Liberation Museum Park. This museum tells the story of the Rwandan Liberation struggle that brought an end to the Genocide against Tutsis. This struggle was initiated by the political wing known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by its military wing, Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), from 1st October 1990 to 4th July 1994. </p>
				
				<p>The museum illustrates sequence of events before, during, and after the struggle through visuals that include texts and artefacts. One of the objects exhibits the bunker which protected the then Chairman of High Command, now President of the Republic of Rwanda, H.E Paul Kagame. Other objects embody the Arusha Agreement, the Campaign against Genocide, radio Muhabura used by the RPF and RPA for mobilisation, likeminded events as well as initiatives. Visitors are always fascinated by the longstanding bunker that sheltered H.E Paul Kagame along other officials’ bunkers. </p>
				
				<p>We are currently going through the consultancy period on the construction of the Liberation Park museum. Consultation will be within Rwanda and directed to the people of Rwanda. The foundation stone was laid by H.E the President of the Republic of Rwanda at “Umurindi w’intwari”.whilst the place is being visited.It is one of 8 sites we have as Instittute of National Museums of Rwanda. </p>
